## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

While developing this little project I tried to apply what I learned about the correct semantics for HTML tags, besides this, I tried to write my CSS code in a more organized way.


### Continued development

Currently I'm focused on learning as much about CSS concepts as I can, while also wanting to reduce the time it takes me to develop a project.
